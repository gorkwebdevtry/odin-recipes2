        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>I first made up this soup for a friend who loves Korean food but lives on a low-carb diet. I thought it would be a one-time wonder, but it is such a forgiving recipe that I now make it when I need a meal with only a few ingredients.</p>
        <p>It can take different vegetables, noodles, and proteins and will still taste good. While the recipe calls for brisket, you can use an equal amount of raw tofu, rotisserie chicken, or canned tuna in this soup with great success. This recipe calls for Tofu Shirataki noodles, which are low-carb Japanese noodles. But if you are not on a low-carb diet, you can use other Asian noodles; I like to use udon or sweet potato noodles.</p>
